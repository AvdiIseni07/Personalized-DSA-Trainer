Task: Generate a competitive-programming (LeetCode/Codeforces) style problem about these techniques, data structures and algorithms: first grade adittion a+ b

Requirements:

1. Title & Statement

* Give the problem a concise title.
* Describe the problem clearly: what you’re given, what you must compute, and any special algorithm twist (for example, “minimum spanning tree,” “shortest path with constraints,” etc.).
* State all input parameters and constraints (limits on n, m, weight ranges, directed/undirected, connectedness, etc.).

2. Examples (3 total)
   For each example, show:
   Input:
   \[example input block]
   Output:
   \[example output]
   Explanation:
   \[brief English explanation of how the output follows from the input]
   Use realistic small graphs (for example, n<=5, m<=7), and show how nodes/edges map to the numbers.

3. Bulk Test Input / Output
   After the examples, on its own line write:
   INPUT
   Provide exactly 7 test cases, each formatted as plain numbers only.
   Between each test case, include a single line containing just !
   Test case format must match the specification given above (for example, first line n and m, followed by m lines of edges, etc.).
   Then on its own line write:
   OUTPUT
   Provide the corresponding 7 outputs, each one formatted exactly as the solution would print.
   If a single test case produces multiple lines, list them one per line.
   Between each test case’s outputs, include a line containing just !

Example of Desired Structure
Title: Minimum Distance in a Weighted Graph

Statement:
You are given an undirected, weighted graph with n nodes and m edges. Find the minimum distance from node 1 to node n.

Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5
1 <= weight <= 10^9

Example 1:
Input:
4 4
1 2 5
2 3 2
2 4 3
3 4 1
Output:
8
Explanation:
Path 1=>2=>3=>4 has total weight 5+2+1=8; path 1=>2=>4 has weight 5+3=8. The minimum is 8.

Example 2:
Input:
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 4
1 3 10
Output:
5
Explanation:
Path 1=>2=>3 gives 1+4=5, which is less than the direct edge weight 10.

Example 3:
Input:
5 6
1 2 2
2 3 3
3 4 4
4 5 5
1 5 20
2 5 10
Output:
12
Explanation:
Best path is 1=>2=>5 = 2+10 = 12.

Tips for the Model:

* Stick exactly to the numeric format—no extra text or blank lines.
* Use realistic but varied test cases (small, edge cases, larger).
* Ensure separators (!) are on lines by themselves.
* Match input/output formatting strictly.
