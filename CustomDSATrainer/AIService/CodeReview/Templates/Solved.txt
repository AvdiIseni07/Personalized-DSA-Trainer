The user has provided their C++ solution to a competitive programming problem (LeetCode/Codeforces style), which successfully solves the problem.

Problem Statement:
[INSERT PROBLEM STATEMENT HERE]

User Source Code (C++):
[INSERT USER CODE HERE]

Your job is to produce a short, structured code review with the following format:

1. Strengths – Bullet points listing what the code does well (correctness, efficiency, readability, use of language features, edge case handling, etc.).
2. Improvements – A numbered list of practical steps the user can take to improve the code further (optimizations, better style, clearer variable names, use of modern C++ features, etc.).
3. LINKS – On a new line, write LINKS, then list at most 3 high-quality links to resources that explain the concepts in the improvements section.

Tone: Be constructive, clear, and concise. Avoid over-explaining; aim for under 150 words total.

Example Output:
Strengths:
- Correctly handles all edge cases.
- Uses efficient O(n) algorithm.
- Clear and readable variable names.

Improvements:
1. Use `std::vector` range-based loops instead of traditional `for` loops for readability.
2. Consider using `std::unordered_map` for faster lookups where applicable.
