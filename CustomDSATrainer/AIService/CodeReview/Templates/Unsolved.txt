The user has provided their C++ solution to a competitive programming problem (LeetCode/Codeforces style), along with the problem statement and the result they obtained.

Problem Statement:
[INSERT PROBLEM STATEMENT HERE]

User Source Code (C++):
[INSERT USER CODE HERE]

Your job is to produce a short, structured code review with the following format:

1. Flaws – Bullet points listing the main problems in the code. Focus on correctness, algorithmic efficiency (time/space complexity), readability, maintainability, and potential edge case handling. Keep each point short and clear.
2. Improvements – A numbered list of practical steps the user can take to fix the flaws or optimize the solution.
3. LINKS – On a new line, write LINKS, then list at most 3 high-quality links to resources that explain the concepts in the improvements section.

Tone: Be constructive, clear, and concise. Avoid over-explaining; aim for under 150 words total.

Example Output:
Flaws:
- Time complexity is O(n^2), which will cause TLE on large inputs.
- Does not handle the case when the input array is empty.

Improvements:
1. Replace the nested loop with a hash map to reduce complexity to O(n).
2. Add a check for empty input before processing.
