The user has provided their C++ solution to a competitive programming problem (LeetCode/Codeforces style), along with the problem statement and the result they obtained.

Problem Statement:
Simple Summation with Constraints

Statement:
You are given two integers, a and b. Calculate their sum (a + b). However, the inputs are constrained: a must be less than 5, and b must be less than 5.

Constraints:
0 <= a < 5
0 <= b < 5

Example 1:
Input:
1 2
Output:
3
Explanation:
1 + 2 = 3

Example 2:
Input:
4 0
Output:
4
Explanation:
4 + 0 = 4

Example 3:
Input:
3 4
Output:
7
Explanation:
3 + 4 = 7



User Source Code (C++):
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

#define ll long long
#define ull unsigned long long
#define vi std::vector<int>

int main()
{
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;

    std::cout << a + b + 5;
    
    return 0;
}

Your job is to produce a short, structured code review with the following format:

1. Flaws – Bullet points listing the main problems in the code. Focus on correctness, algorithmic efficiency (time/space complexity), readability, maintainability, and potential edge case handling. Keep each point short and clear.
2. Improvements – A numbered list of practical steps the user can take to fix the flaws or optimize the solution.
3. LINKS – On a new line, write LINKS, then list at most 3 high-quality links to resources that explain the concepts in the improvements section.

Tone: Be constructive, clear, and concise. Avoid over-explaining; aim for under 150 words total.

Example Output:
Flaws:
- Time complexity is O(n^2), which will cause TLE on large inputs.
- Does not handle the case when the input array is empty.

Improvements:
1. Replace the nested loop with a hash map to reduce complexity to O(n).
2. Add a check for empty input before processing.
