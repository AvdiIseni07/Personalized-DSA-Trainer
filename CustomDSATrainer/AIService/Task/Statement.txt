**Problem:**

You are given a directed graph with *n* nodes labeled from 0 to *n-1*. You are also given a list of edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple (u, v), indicating a directed edge from node *u* to node *v*. A "safe node" is a node that is not part of any cycle, or from which all paths lead to the terminal nodes (nodes with no outgoing edges). Your task is to find all safe nodes in the graph and return them in ascending order.

**Input:**

*   *n*: The number of nodes in the graph.
*   *edges*: A list of directed edges, where each edge is a tuple (u, v).

**Example 1:**

*n* = 7
*edges* = `[[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,4]]`

The graph has a cycle: 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 4. Nodes 4, 5, and 6 are therefore not safe. All other nodes (0, 1, 2, 3) are safe.

**Example 2:**

*n* = 4
*edges* = `[[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]`

There are no cycles in the graph.  All nodes (0, 1, 2, 3) are safe.

**Example 3:**

*n* = 1
*edges* = `[]`

There are no edges in the graph. The node 0 is safe.
