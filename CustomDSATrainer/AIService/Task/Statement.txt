Title: Critical Edges

Statement:
You are given a connected, undirected graph with *n* nodes and *m* edges. A *critical edge* (also known as a bridge) is an edge that, if removed, would disconnect the graph. Your task is to find the number of critical edges in the given graph.

Constraints:
2 <= *n* <= 1000
*n*-1 <= *m* <= *n*(*n*-1)/2
The graph is guaranteed to be connected.
The nodes are numbered from 1 to *n*.
There are no self-loops or parallel edges.

Example 1:
Input:
4 3
1 2
2 3
3 4
Output:
3
Explanation:
Removing any of the edges disconnects the graph into two or more components.  Hence all the edges are critical.

Example 2:
Input:
5 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 1
Output:
0
Explanation:
Removing any edge will not disconnect the graph because of the cycle 1-2-3-4-5-1.

Example 3:
Input:
6 7
1 2
2 3
1 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
4 6
Output:
0
Explanation:
No edge is critical here because of the multiple paths connecting each node.
