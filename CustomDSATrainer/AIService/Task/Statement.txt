Title: Tree Product Path

Statement:
You are given a rooted tree with n nodes, numbered from 1 to n. Node 1 is the root. Each node i has a value associated with it, `value[i]`. Your task is to find the number of paths from the root to a leaf node where the product of the values along the path is less than 25.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= value[i] <= 4 for all i
The tree is represented by a list of edges.

Input:
The first line contains an integer n, the number of nodes in the tree.
The second line contains n integers, `value[1] value[2] ... value[n]`, representing the values of the nodes.
The next n-1 lines each contain two integers, u and v, representing an edge between node u and node v.

Output:
Print a single integer: the number of paths from the root to a leaf where the product of the values is less than 25.

Example 1:
Input:
4
1 2 3 4
1 2
1 3
2 4
Output:
2
Explanation:
Node values are [1, 2, 3, 4]. Edges are 1-2, 1-3, 2-4.
Paths from root (1) to leaves are:
1 -> 3: Product is 1 * 3 = 3 < 25
1 -> 2 -> 4: Product is 1 * 2 * 4 = 8 < 25
So there are 2 such paths.

Example 2:
Input:
5
2 3 0 1 2
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
Output:
3
Explanation:
Node values are [2, 3, 0, 1, 2].
Paths from root (1) to leaves are:
1 -> 3: Product is 2 * 0 = 0 < 25
1 -> 2 -> 4: Product is 2 * 3 * 1 = 6 < 25
1 -> 2 -> 5: Product is 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 < 25
So there are 3 such paths.

Example 3:
Input:
3
4 4 4
1 2
1 3
Output:
0
Explanation:
Node values are [4, 4, 4].
Paths from root (1) to leaves are:
1 -> 2: Product is 4 * 4 = 16 < 25
1 -> 3: Product is 4 * 4 = 16 < 25
The number of valid paths is 0, since node 2 and 3 are not leaf nodes.
