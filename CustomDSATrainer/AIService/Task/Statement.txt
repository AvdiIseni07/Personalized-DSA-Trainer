Title: Maximum Candies

Statement:
You are given n bags of candies. Each bag contains a certain number of candies. You have k children to distribute the candies to. You can only give each child candies from at most one bag. Find the maximum number of candies each child can receive, assuming you distribute candies optimally.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= k <= 10^9
1 <= candies in each bag <= 10^9

Example 1:
Input:
4 3
15 17 12 20
Output:
5
Explanation:
Give 15/3 = 5 candies to each of 3 children from the first bag.

Example 2:
Input:
5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Output:
1
Explanation:
Each child can only receive 1 candy because each bag only has at most 5 candies.

Example 3:
Input:
3 2
10 10 3
Output:
5
Explanation:
Give 10/2 = 5 candies to each child from the first or second bag. The 3rd bag only allows 3/2 = 1 candies.
